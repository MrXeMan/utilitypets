# Utility Pets

Utility Pets introduces a set of tamable creatures, each equipped with unique and practical abilities that support the player during survival.
These companions are more than pets — they provide real utility, help gather resources, perform tasks, and even join you in combat.

Every pet serves a clear purpose, making your world more dynamic, efficient, and fun to explore.

## ✨ Features
- Tamable utility mobs designed to provide practical gameplay benefits

- Pets can produce valuable resources, such as a spider pet that generates string

- Some pets act as mobile workstations, like a walking furnace that smelts items much faster than a normal one

- All pets are fully capable of fighting, defending the player and dealing damage to enemies

- Each creature has a specific and easy-to-understand role, enhancing everyday survival gameplay

## 🎮 Examples
- Lucas the spider – passively produces string over time and helps in combat

- Furny – a portable super-furnace that smelts items significantly faster than the standard block

- (More utility-focused and combat-ready pets coming soon!)
